# Project Information

This document provides a detailed overview of the project's structure, including the purpose of each folder and file.

## Root Directory Files

- **`.env`**: Stores environment variables for the application, such as database credentials, secret keys, and other configuration settings. This file is not committed to version control.

- **`package-lock.json`**: Records the exact versions of npm dependencies and their sub-dependencies. Ensures consistent installations across different environments.
- **`package.json`**: Defines project metadata, scripts (e.g., for starting the development server), and lists npm dependencies for frontend assets or build tools.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project. Used by `pip` to install these packages.

## `config/` Directory

This directory contains configuration files for the application.

- **`__init__.py`**: Makes the `config` directory a Python package.
- **`db_config.py`**: Contains database-specific configurations, such as the database URI, connection parameters, and potentially SQLAlchemy setup.
- **`settings.py`**: Holds general application settings and constants, such as API keys (though sensitive keys are better in `.env`), feature flags, or application behavior parameters.

## `docs/` Directory

This directory contains documentation files for the project.

- **`DECRYPTION.md`**: Markdown file detailing the decryption process used in the application.

## `media/` Directory

This directory is used for storing static media files.

- **`images/`**: Contains image files used in the application.
    - **`logo.jpg`**: The application's logo.
- **`public-keys/`**: Stores public keys of users or administrators. These are likely used for encryption or signature verification.
    - `admin1-1admin-PublicKey.pem`, `admin1-ADMIN1admin-PublicKey.pem`, etc.: Individual public key files, likely named by user/admin identifiers.
- **`text-files/`**: Could be used for storing uploaded text files or other text-based media. Currently empty in the provided structure.

## `models/` Directory

This directory contains the data models for the application, typically representing database tables or data structures.

- **`__init__.py`**: Makes the `models` directory a Python package.
- **`file_model.py`**: Defines the data model for files, including attributes like filename, path, owner, upload date, etc.
- **`session_model.py`**: Defines the data model for user sessions, potentially storing session IDs, user associations, and expiration times.
- **`threshold_model.py`**: Defines data models related to threshold cryptography schemes, such as shares, reconstruction parameters, or associated file information.
- **`user_model.py`**: Defines the data model for users, including attributes like username, password (hashed), email, roles, etc.

## `routes/` Directory

This directory contains the route definitions for the application, organized into blueprints. Each file typically handles a specific set of related endpoints.

- **`__init__.py`**: Makes the `routes` directory a Python package and may also be used to import and register blueprints with the main Flask app.
- **`auth_routes.py`**: Defines routes related to user authentication, such as login, registration, logout, and password management.
- **`dashboard_routes.py`**: Defines routes for user dashboards, displaying user-specific information or actions.
- **`file_routes.py`**: Defines routes for file management operations, such as uploading, downloading, listing, and deleting files.
- **`threshold_routes.py`**: Defines routes related to threshold cryptography operations, such as initiating threshold uploads, managing shares, or performing threshold decryption.

## `services/` Directory

This directory contains the business logic of the application, separated from the route handlers and data models. Service modules typically encapsulate specific functionalities.

- **`__init__.py`**: Makes the `services` directory a Python package.
- **`auth_service.py`**: Contains business logic for user authentication, such as verifying credentials, managing user sessions, and handling registration processes.
- **`file_service.py`**: Contains business logic for file operations, including handling file uploads/downloads, managing file metadata, and interacting with storage.
- **`threshold_service.py`**: Contains business logic for threshold cryptography schemes, such as generating shares, reconstructing secrets, and managing related data.
- **`user_service.py`**: Contains business logic for user management, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting user accounts.

## `templates/` Directory

This directory contains HTML templates used by Flask to render web pages.

- **`base.html`**: A base template that other templates can inherit from. Typically includes common layout elements like headers, footers, and navigation bars.
- **`confirm-download.html`**: Template for a page confirming a file download action.
- **`download.html`**: Template for the file download page, possibly allowing users to select files to download.
- **`file-list.html`**: Template for displaying a list of available files.
- **`index.html`**: The main landing page or homepage template for the application.
